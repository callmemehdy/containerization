# 🧠 Inception

A secure, containerized web server infrastructure built using **Docker** from scratch. This project sets up a complete **WordPress + MariaDB** stack with **Nginx**, running inside isolated Docker containers, orchestrated using `docker-compose`.

Developed as part of the [1337/42 Network Curriculum](https://1337.ma/), the goal is to understand system administration, containerization, and secure service configuration.
